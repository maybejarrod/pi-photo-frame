# pi-photo-frame
A simple Raspberry Pi photo frame web page, built on PHP.

This is intended to run on a Raspberry PI in fullscreen mode. It can however be run on any server or stack that supports PHP.

This is my initial guide. I have been refining the layout ever since. 
This will help you get started, if you need help setting up your PI.
